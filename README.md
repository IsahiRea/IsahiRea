I'm Cesar Rea, a software developer who loves tinkering with code and building cool stuff. I'm all about backend development and I'm on the lookout for a job in that space. You'll find a bunch of my projects and open-source contributions here. I'm always up for learning something new. Let's connect and create something extraordinary together!
